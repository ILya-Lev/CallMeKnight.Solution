An attempt to solve CallMeKnight challenge from dotnet chapter Luxoft Nov 2024.

Challenge author [Andrey Mishkinis](https://github.com/andreymi-nx).

The best solution is in class [CallMeKnightSolverFrequenciesBigInteger](https://github.com/ILya-Lev/CallMeKnight.Solution/blob/master/src/CallMeKnight.Lib/CallMeKnightSolverFrequenciesBigInteger.cs).
It is based on O(N) algorithm.

Optimized straightforward solution is in class [CallMeKnightSolverSequences2Steps](https://github.com/ILya-Lev/CallMeKnight.Solution/blob/master/src/CallMeKnight.Lib/CallMeKnightSolverSequences2Steps.cs).
It is based on O((20/9)^N) algorithm.
